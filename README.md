# Stock_Price_Prediction_Using_Keras_And_LSTM-RNN

1.numpy()
2.matplotlib(plot will be used to plot graph and write labels)
3.pandas(to read .csv file and to concat between two dataset)
4.sklearn(MinMaxScaler preserves the shape of the original distribution)
5.keras(Sequential to initialise RNN,Dense to add more layer,LSTM for layer,Dropout for regularisation)
